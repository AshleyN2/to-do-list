Revisiting and polishing my phase 0 project.

# Simple To-Do List App
This is a simple to do list app that allows a user to add tasks and delete them upon completion. 

### Requirements

This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, so it is important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into the project in some way. 
For example, you could use a mouseover event to change the appearance of an element when the user mouses over it or use a click event to toggle some content between being visible and hidden.
There are a variety of ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned so far, but don't forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google is an invaluable tool for developers! 
Try to use this project as an opportunity to stretch your coding skills!....
